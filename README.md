## The Why

Inspired by Leo Babauta's MITs (http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/).

MITs is a system I've been using for the past several years to get shit done.

I use a traditional bloated Todo process for all the little things, but I like something clean and simple for my MITs.

On Thursday April 19th I thought: "wouldn't it be nice to just see these MITs big and in the browser, easily accessible via a pinned tab in Chrome".

So on Friday April 20th Big Todo's was born.

Boom.

## Skillz

This project was apart of me improving my mark-up skills and leaning JavaScript. It's not perfect but it works! 

## How To

It's pretty simple. Pull down the repo and open index.html in a browser. You're done.


## Have fun.

Stay classy.
