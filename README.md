## The Why

Inspired by Leo Babauta's MITs (http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/).

MITs is a system I've been using for the past several years to get shit done.

I use a traditional bloated Todo process for all the little things, but I like something clean and simple for my MITs outside.

One day I thought wouldn't it be nice to just see these MITs big and in the browser, easily accessible via a pinned tab in Chrome.

Big Todo's was born.

## Skillz

I've been  my mark-up and JS skills. This isn't perfect but it works! 

## How To

It's pretty simple. Pull down the repo and open index.html in a browser. You're done.


## Have fun.

Stay classy.
