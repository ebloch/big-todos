## The Why

Inspired by Leo Babauta's MITs (http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/).

It's a system I've been using for the past several years to get shit done.

I have a tradiontal bloated Todo process but I still found myself specifying MITs outside of this sytem.

One day I thought wouldn't it be nice to just see these MITs big and in the browser, easily accesibly as a pinned tab in Chrome.

Big Todo's was born.

## Skillz

I've been  my mark-up and JS skils. This isn't perfect but it works! 


## How To

It's pretty simple. Pull down the repo and open index.html in a browser. You're done.



Have fun.

Stay classy.
